Season starts on <span date>September 15th 2025</span>, and
runs through <span date offset="73">November 30th 2025</span>.</p></li></ul><h3 class="under" id="Where">Where:</h3><ul><li><p>Players decide where to play their matches, but typically central Sonoma County locations like Santa Rosa or Rohnert Park.</p></li></ul><h3 class="under" id="Frequency">Frequency:</h3><ul><li><p>Each round (set
of matches) runs for 1.5 weeks, and will start
on Mondays or Thursdays in alternating
fashion.</p></li></ul><h3 class="under" id="Confirming-Availability">Confirming Availability:</h3><ul><li><p>In order to be included in the groups each round,
you will need to <a target="_blank" href="confirm_availability.html">confirm that you
are available</a> before the round starts.
<i>'Being available' entails being able to offer
multiple possible time-windows in which you can
play, and being willing to play after standard work
hours (many participants are not yet retired 😊).</i></p></li><li><p>If you don't have much availability for a particular round or don't wish to play because of injury or anything else, you don't have to do anything (you are assumed unavailable if you don't confirm).</p></li></ul><h3 class="under" id="Groupings">Groupings:</h3><ul><li><p>Players will be grouped in groups of 4 at the start
of each round. These are determined by a combination of Standings position and
availability. Group 1 will be comprised of the
4 highest-standing available players. Group 2
will be the next 4, and so on. (Note: if the number of
available players is not a multiple of 4, the last
group will have to be completed with subs).</p><li><p>Groupings can be found on the <a target="_blank" href="groups.html">Groups Page</a>.
They will be updated on the first day of each round and you will be
notified (by email) as soon as they are ready.</p></li></ul><h3 class="under" id="Scheduling">Scheduling:</h3><ul><li><p>Once you receive the email at the start of each round which tells you
the new groups are ready,
identify your group on the
<a target="_blank" href="groups.html">Groups Page</a>
and initiate communication with everyone via a single email or text
thread to coordinate when and where you will play.</li><li><p>If you are unable to land on a viable time for all 4
of you, your group can get a sub (or multiple subs if
necessary) to replace whoever is least available. A sub may also
be called in if a player has not responded to the others'
efforts to schedule after 2 days notice or more.</p></li></ul><h3 class="under" id="Unforeseen-circumstances">Unforeseen
Circumstances:</h3><ul><p>If one or more players in your
group get sick, injured, or are otherwise unable to play
due to exceptional circumstances, the following
applies:</p><li><p>The missing players drop 1 place in the Ladder
Standings for the following round (as they would if
they had otherwise not been available).</p></li><li><p>The rest of you should try to a get a sub (and
reschedule if necessary). If this is not possible –
perhaps it is the last day of the round (pro tip: don't schedule your match for the last day of the
round) – your group will not play and everyone in
it will drop 1 spot in the Standings).</p></li></ul><h3 class="under" id="Subs">Sub(stitute)s:</h3><ul><p>As I'm
sure you gathered from reading the above, there will
inevitably be groups that end up needing subs throughout
the course of the Ladder Season.</p><li><p>Subs do
not have to be in the Ladder, but should ideally be
of a similar skill level.</p></li><li><p>The <a target="_blank" href="subs.html">Subs
Page</a> can help facilitate the process of finding a
sub. Anyone interested in subbing for a particular round
can submit their name, and you can see everyone who is
offering.</p></li><li><p>When submitting scores, please name
the sub as 'FirstName LastName (Sub)' (replacing the name of
the person they subbed in for in the appropriate cell of the
spreadsheet if submitting via spreadsheet). Example: <i style="color:#4b6403" randomname apnd=" (Sub)">John Doe
(Sub)</i>.</p></li><li><p>Subs' scores do not count for those they are
subbing in for. (Remaining players' scores count as normal).</p></li><li><p>In exceptional circumstances, I as the Ladder Administrator may allow a
sub's scores to count for that sub if they were unable to play in their own
group, but were able to fill in for a missing player in an adjacent
group.</p></li></ul><h3 class="under" id="Punctuality">Punctuality:</h3><ul><li><p>Please don’t be late! Be conscious that others in
your group have arranged their schedule to play at that
specific time. If you’re late, you may be significantly
inconveniencing or frustrating them.</p></li><li><p>To be fair to all the other players, unless it’s an
emergency, or there are extenuating circumstances, the
following penalties apply for arriving late past the
scheduled start time:<br><p class="thin"><p><i>15-30 mins late</i> :: your
opponents get a 3 point head start in every game to 11
(a 5 point head start in every game to 15).</p></p><p class="thin"><p><i>30-45 mins late</i> :: your
opponents get an 5 point head start in every game to 11
(a 8 point head start in every game to 15).</p></p><p class="thin"><p><i>45+ mins late</i> :: your opponents
get an 7 point head start in every game to 11 (a 11
point head start in every game to 15).</p></p><p class="thin"><p><i>No-show</i> :: you will not be able
to play the next round. (Please report to me if anyone
in your group is a no-show so I can enforce
this 😊).</p></p></p></li></ul><h3 class="under" id="Format">Format:</h3><ul><li><p>Round-robin, 6 games to 11, win by 2, (don't
switch sides mid-game).</p></li><li><p><i>If all 4
players in your group agree to it, you may play 3
games to 15 (switch sides at 8), or 3 games to 11
(switch at 6).</i></p></li><li><p><span id="order">The <a id="seed1" href="javascript: void (0)" onclick='this.classList.toggle("hidden"),document.getElementById("seedexp").classList.toggle("hidden"),setTimeout(function(){document.getElementById("seedexp").classList.toggle("hidden"),document.getElementById("seed1").classList.toggle("hidden")},1e4)'>#1 seed</a> <span class="hidden" id="seedexp"><b>highest

side of the court the second time you play with the same person.</b></p></li><li><p><i>Note: As per public court policy, you will need to rotate off between
games if there are players waiting, and then you can rotate on to the next available court.</i></p></li></ul><h3 class="under" id="Submitting-your-scores">Submitting Your
Scores:</h3><ul><li><p>Please keep track of your scores
after each game finishes and make sure everyone in your
group agrees with them at the end of play.</p></li><li><p>It is every group's responsibility to submit their
scores before the end of each
round, as they are used to compute the
new Standings for the next round. Failure to submit on time will result
in all players in the group dropping one ranking spot (the
same as if they hadn't played). Since nobody
wants this to happen, it is a good practice to submit them the
same day right after playing. You may want to nominate
one player from your group to do the
submission.</p></li><li><p>To submit scores,
please visit the <a target="_blank" href="scores.html">Submit
Scores Page</a>. You will have the choice to submit via form
submission or enter them directly into the <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="scores_spreadsheet.html">Scores Spreadsheet</a>. Submitting by
spreadsheet is preferable if you have access to a computer (it is not very
usable on a phone).</p></li><li><p>Please look at the <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="scores_spreadsheet.html">Scores Spreadsheet</a> the day before the
start of the next round if possible to check that your group's scores appear
correct. Once the next round starts, they will not be able to be
changed.</p></li></ul><h3 class="under" id="Moving-up-or-down">Moving Up or
Down:</h3><ul><li><p>New Standings will be formed each round based on the
previous round's results.</p></li><li><p>There are two operations which are
performed to calculate these):</p></li></ul><ol><li><p>Firstly, the
players who played that round are re-ranked based on their seed number
(relative rank within group) and how they finished in their group (see 'Players
Playing Re-ranked' rows in the <a target="_blank" href="results.html">Results
sheet</a>). <b>You finish 1st(/4th) in your group by having the
highest(/lowest) point differential (points won – points lost)</b>.<p>This table below shows how you move up
(←) or down (→) initially according to different
finishes.</p><table><tr><td class="head"></td><td class="head" colspan="5">Seed</td></tr><tr><td class="head" rowspan="6">Finish</td></tr><tr><td class="head"></td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>1st</td><td class="move">← 2</td><td class="move">← 3</td><td class="move">←

behind the movement is that the 1st seed
(highest ranked player) is expected to win the
group and therefore moves up less for doing so. If
the 1st seed gets last in the group however, they
are losing to 3 lower ranked players and therefore
should be dropped below all of them. The same concept
applies for the other 3 seeds. This system allows for more
movement when the rankings are inaccurate and should result
in less movement as the rankings start to become more
accurate.</p></p></li><p><i>Mid-way through the season, the formula will switch to that depicted below, which is more suitable once
everyone has approached their appropriate
position in the Ladder Standings and less
movement is optimal.</i></p><table id="table-formula-2"><tr><td class="head"></td><td class="head" colspan="5">Seed</td></tr><tr><td class="head" rowspan="6">Finish</td></tr><tr><td class="head"></td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>1st</td><td class="move" id="f1s1">← 1</td><td class="move" id="f1s2">← 2</td><td class="move" id="f1s3">← 3</td><td class="move" id="f1s4">←

(excluding any subs) forms the basis for
the next round's Ladder Standings, but the
players who did not play that round will be
inserted into the new standings 1 place lower down then they
were at the start of the round. For
example, if the player ranked 13th in the
Ladder Standings does not play one round,
they will be the 14th ranked player the next
round (unseating and bumping down whoever was
previously occupying the 14th spot in the 'Players
Playing Re-ranked' list).</p></li></ol><ul><li><p><i>Note: When you move up, you improve your
position in the Standings (your ranking), but
you will not necessarily find yourself in a
higher group the next round, as groups are determined
by a combination of rankings and
