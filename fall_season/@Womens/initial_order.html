(or pressing the arrow-up and arrow-down keys in combination with the
control key).</p><p>Please be as thoughtful and accurate as possible when changing your
position. Don't just look to see if you are as good as the person 5 spots
above you, but also ask yourself if you would always beat the person 5
spots below you. Try to place yourself in a position where your level is
between the average levels of the 5 players above and below you.</p><p>Click the 'Save Order' button to save any changes you make and the
'Refresh Order' button to get the most recent version that has been saved.</p><p>Please try to make and save your edits quickly after loading the page (or
refresh the order and promptly make any edits before saving). Otherwise
you may be saving an an outdated version because others may have made
edits in the meantime. In order to limit any 'outdatedness', the order
will be automatically refreshed every minute (which means that if you have
any unsaved changes, they will be lost). Please do not leave this tab open
when you are not using it, so that you are not making unnecessary
background queries.</p><h2>Info:</h2><p>The initial version of this initial starting order (which you will not be
able to see once people start making edits, but which you can find
<a target="_blank" href="inital_initial_order.html">here</a>), is just a
ranked list based on the ratings each player submitted when signing up.
Wherever there were multiple players with the same rating, they were
sorted based on when they signed up.</p><h2>Color Code:</h2><p>Orange:
<span style="color:orange">this player has edited their position and it is higher up than it was
initially.</span><br>Purple:
<span style="color:#996ec4">this player has edited their position and it is lower down than it was
initially.</span><br>No highlight: this player has not edited their position or it is the same
as it was initially.</p><section class="h"><h2>More Info / About:</h2><p>This page is the result of a whimsical idea of mine to try to implement
a sort of virtual line-up. It was scrapped together rather hastily and
has not been extensively tested, so it may be buggy. If it is apparent
that this proccess is not working, I may close it and use a fallback
method instead.</p></section><script src="../js/pls.js"></script></body></html>
