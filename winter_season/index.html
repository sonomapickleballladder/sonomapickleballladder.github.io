competitive play for the many players seeking it!</p>For anyone new to the Ladder concept:<ul><li>Ladder play is all about offering well-matched games to
similarly-skilled players.</li><li>Players who are available each round play a round-robin within a group of four.</li><li>They then move up or down in the Ladder rankings based on how they finish within their group. Sooner or later, everyone should find their most appropriate place in the Ladder, leading to well-balanced matches.</li></ul><p>This winter season will run from mid-January through mid-April. I am offering an Open Ladder and a Women's Ladder. The round-length will be 2 weeks.<p hidden>Please also note, I am charging what I hope is an affordable administrative fee. This covers the time it takes me to set up
players for participation initially, as well as to calculate results, determine groups, communicate with players, and update certain parts of the website each round.</p>Theo MacKinnon<br>December 2024<p>P.S. Please do not post anything about the Ladder on social media. You are, of course, welcome to share the <span class="copy" onclick='copy("https://s.42l.fr/splwinter",0,this)'>link to the
website</span> with friends, and talk it up in person at the courts!</p><br></section><footer><i><small>&#169; 2022-2025 Theo MacKinnon. All rights reserved.
