been formed, you will open the <a target="_blank" href="groups.html">Groups Page</a> (the link to which will also be included in the email). Identify your group and fellow
competitors for the current/approaching round. After having done so, please initiate communication with <b>everyone</b> in your group
via <b>a single all-person email or text thread</b> to offer/suggest <b style="color:gray">playing
times and locations</b> that will work for all 4 of you, taking into account
anticipated weather.
Scheduling your match for sooner rather than later is better in case weather causes postponement.</p></li><li><p>If you are unable to land on a viable time for all 4 of you, your group can get a
sub (or multiple subs if necessary) to replace whoever is least available<span class="h" hidden> (or whoever's availability is the least in sync with everyone else's)</span>. A sub may also be called in if a player has not
responded to the others' efforts to schedule. However, please give all players in
your group reasonable opportunity – at least a couple of days – to communicate and offer times before proceeding to the <a href="#Subs">sub step</a>.</p></li><li><p>As the Ladder Administrator, I expect all players to have respectful
communication and to be able to resolve scheduling issues/disputes amongst
themselves. I do not want to have to get involved! If it does reach that
stage, please start by sharing the all-person email thread or a picture of the text thread that you have
used to <a style="color:red" href="mailto:SPLSchedulingDisputes_Emergency_Only@riseup.net">SPLSchedulingDisputes_Emergency_Only@riseup.net</a>.</p></li><li id="snotelink"><a onclick='document.getElementById("snotelink").classList.toggle("h"),document.getElementById("snote").classList.toggle("h")' href="#snotetop">Special note about Scheduling ➕</a></li><div class="h" id="snote"><li id="snotetop"><a onclick='document.getElementById("snote").classList.toggle("h"),document.getElementById("snotelink").classList.toggle("h")' href="#snotetop">Special note about Scheduling ➖</a></li><i><p>Ladder play does not have to happen at off-peak hours. You are perfectly entitled to play your Ladder matches between 9am and 12pm at the public courts — i.e. during what is considered "peak time" — when there are cooler temperatures and typically less wind. So by all means offer morning times in the scheduling process.</p><p>At any time, if all courts are full however, please note that you must be willing to rotate off between games. And then you can rotate back on (probably within just a few minutes) to the next available court.</p><p>Further, the City of Santa Rosa policy is that "The courts are open for all to play on during peak hours... the courts must be shared, but it does not dictate who or how people play. [Players] must rotate off the court after one game but can rotate back in as a group ... [The policy] acknowledges that not everyone wants to rotate in with people they do not know or people at another level of play."</p><p>Court capacity at Finley, especially during weekday mornings, is now substantially increased with the addition of 6 more cross-lined courts with high-quality nets available for use.</p></i></div></ul><h3 class="under" id="Unforeseen-circumstances">Unforeseen Circumstances:</h3><ul><p>If one or more players in your group get sick,
injured, or are otherwise unable to play due to exceptional circumstances,
the following applies:</p><li><p>The missing players drop 1 place in the Ladder Standings for the
following round (as they would if they had otherwise not been available).</p></li><li><p>The rest of you should try to a get a sub (and reschedule if necessary). If this is not possible — perhaps it is the last day of a round (hint: please don't schedule your match for the last day of a round) –
your group will not play and everyone in it will drop 1 spot in the Standings).</p></li></ul><h3 class="under" id="Subs">Sub(stitute)s:</h3><ul><p>As I'm sure you gathered from reading the above, there will inevitably be groups that end up needing subs throughout the course of the Ladder Season.</p><li><p>Subs do not have to be in the Ladder, but should ideally be of a
similar skill level.</p></li><li><p>I have made a <a target="_blank" href="subs.html">Subs Page</a> to help facilitate the process of finding a sub. Anyone interested in subbing for a particular round can submit their name, and you can see everyone who is offering.</p></li><li><p>When submitting scores, please name the sub as
'FirstName LastName (Sub)' (replacing the name of the person they subbed in for in the appropriate cell of the spreadsheet if submitting via spreadsheet). Example: <i style="color:#4b6403" randomname apnd=" (Sub)">John Doe (Sub)</i>.</p></li><li><p>Subs' scores do not count for those they are subbing in for. (Remaining players' scores count as normal).</p></li><li><p>In exceptional circumstances, I as the Ladder Administrator may allow a
sub's scores to count for that sub if they were unable to play in
their own group, but were able to fill in for a missing player in an
adjacent group.</p></li></ul><h3 class="under" id="Punctuality">Punctuality:</h3><ul><li><p>Please don’t be late! Be conscious that others in your group have arranged their schedule to play at that specific time.
