If there's nothing there, it's possible your email provider can't receive automated emails from the service used. Please don't panic or message me in this case. I will be able to see that you didn't receive it, and will send you a [non-automated] confirmation email ${JSON.parse(getRound())>0?"as soon as possible":"<b>shortly after the initial registration deadline</b>"}`</script></details><details name="login"><summary>&nbsp;I am unable to log in.</summary><br><span class="a">Firstly, make sure you have signed up AND confirmed your email address. Then check that you are entering your email (not your name) and secret key exactly as you did on the <a target="_blank" href="signup_form.html">Sign-up Form</a>. Please also make sure you are not trying to use any credentials / saved logins you might have from previous ladder seasons, as these are only valid on a season by season basis.<br><br>If you think you have entered everything correctly but it still isn't working, please email me. I will send you a one-time magic link, which should get you into your dashboard. From there, you can copy your permanent login link under where it says 'Messages' and make note of the credentials it autofills when you open it.</span></details><details name="secret-key"><summary>&nbsp;I forgot my secret key.</summary><br><span class="a">Check if you can <a href="signup_form.html#view-responses">view your responses</a> to the Signup Form and unhide your secret key (you may not be able to do so depending on your browser settings, or if you're using a different device/browser than you used to register)</a>.<br><br>If not, you can <a href="mailto:SPLinfo+magiclink@riseup.net?Subject=Winter Ladder | Login Credentials&body=Hi Theo,%0AI have forgotten my secret key. Could you send me a magic link?%0AThanks,%0AYour name">send me an email</a> and I will send you a link which you can use to log in. If you email me before the <a href="signup.html#regdealine">initial registration deadline</a>, you may not get a response until after the deadline, as you shouldn't need to log in before then.</details><details name="skill-level"><summary>&nbsp;Do I have to be a certain skill level to join?</summary><br><span class="a">All skill levels are very welcome! Previous seasons have had players ranging from around 2.5 to 5.0+. Anyone wishing to participate however, should at least have a solid understanding of the rules of the game, and ideally some prior experience playing competitively. If you're concerned there won't be enough other players around your exact skill level, try to encourage as many similarly-skilled players as possible to also sign up so as to ensure your ladder experience is an enjoyable and competitive one.</span></details><details name="cost"><summary>&nbsp;How much does it cost?</summary><br><span class="a">$50. (I do not want the price to be a barrier to entry, so if it is, please email me and I can probably offer you a discount).</span></details><details name="venmo"><summary>&nbsp;Can I pay with Venmo?</summary><br><span class="a">Yes. Please refer to the <a href="signup.html#pay">payment section</a> on the signup page.</details><details hidden><summary>&nbsp;Which Ladder will have the strongest players?</summary><br><span class="a">Probably the Open Ladder. You are welcome to email me though before signing up and ask which one the majority of players at your skill level are choosing.</span></details><details name="location"><summary>&nbsp;Where are matches played?</summary><br><span class="a">That is up to your group each round. Most groups choose to play at Finley, Sunrise or Howarth, and sometimes Airport Club or Lucchesi</span></details><details name="absense"><summary>&nbsp;Will it work for me to join the Ladder if I will be away certain weeks?</summary><br><span class="a">Absolutely! The Ladder is set up to
accommodate players traveling.</span></details><details name="multiple-ladders"><summary>&nbsp;Can I sign up for both Ladders?</summary><br><span class="a">Yes, so long as you intend to play in them both.</span></details><details hidden><summary>&nbsp;Can I join any additional Ladders to the one(s) I initially signed up for later?</summary><br><span class="a">Yes, but it's simpler if you just sign up for all the ones you wish to be in initially.</span></details><details name="switching-ladders"><summary>&nbsp;Can I switch Ladders later (after signing up initially)?</summary><br><span class="a">You can up until the initial registration deadline by simply emailing me.</span></details><details name="updating-information"><summary>&nbsp;How can I change information I entered incorrectly in the Signup Form?</summary><br><span class="a">You can email me the desired changes and I will actualize them.</details><details hidden><summary>&nbsp;Why is the round length 2 weeks this season?</summary><br><span class="a">I have received feedback that 1-week rounds feel too short when I have tried them in the past, and also that 2-week rounds feel very spread out. I'm hoping that 2 weeks can make for a better balance.</span></details><details name="ladder-formats"><summary>&nbsp;Why are the other ladder formats that have been offered in the past (skinny singles, singles, men's, etc..) not being offered this season?</summary><br><span class="a">Because these have not generated very much interest previously, and there is a lot of setup work involved in offering more ladders, which I do not wish to undertake unless I am reasonably certain there is a significant amount of interest. If you know of a lot of people who would like to participate in a ladder format which is not currently being offered, you can let me know by email and I will certainly consider offering it again in the future.</span></details><details name="privacy"><summary>&nbsp;How is my information secured/protected?</summary><br><span class="a">All the information you submit through the Sign-up Form is stored in an encrypted database, which only I as the administrator can access.
None of it will ever be shared with or sold to any 3rd party entities.
Certain information though, such as your name, email, and phone number if you choose to provide one, will be entered into a spreadsheet which is visible to the other players in whichever ladder(s) you are in.<br><br>When signing up, you are welcome to use an <a href="https://addy.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">email alias</a> if you don't want your real email address to be visible.
You don't have to provide your real name either if you prefer not to.
Please do not provide any information which would cause you alarm if someone else were to somehow get their hands on it.
Your secret key should not contain any confidential information, or be the same as a password you use for any important account.
If you are hesitant to provide any of the information asked for, please let me know.
However, most of it is necessary to run the service.</span></details><details name="troubleshooting"><summary>&nbsp;A certain page isn't loading.</summary><br><span class="a">Check your internet connection and open it on another device or in a different browser if possible. If this doesn't make a difference, please email me with as much info as you can provide and I will do my best to troubleshoot.</span></details></div></section><footer><i><small>&#169; 2022-2025 Theo MacKinnon.
