competitive play for the many players seeking it!</p>For anyone new to the Ladder concept:<ul><li>Ladder play is all about offering well-matched games to
similarly-skilled players.</li><li>Players who are available each round play a round-robin within a
group of four.</li><li>They then move up or down in the Ladder rankings based on how they
finish within their group. Sooner or later, everyone should find
their most appropriate place in the Ladder, leading to well-balanced
matches.</li></ul><p>This Spring season will run from early-February through early-May. I
am offering an Open Ladder and a Women's Ladder. The round-length will
be 2 weeks and there will be 6 rounds in total. See the
<a href="how_it_works.html">How it Works</a> page for complete
details.</p><p hidden>Please also note, I am charging what I hope is an affordable
administrative fee. This covers the time it takes me to set up players
for participation initially, as well as to calculate results,
determine groups, communicate with players, and update certain parts
of the website each round.</p>Theo MacKinnon<br>January 2026</section><footer><i><small>&#169; 2022-2026 Theo MacKinnon. All rights reserved. No part of
